# About

The Task Track app is a task management tool that allows users to create and organize their tasks. The app is built using the MERN stack, which consists of the following technologies:

- MongoDB: a document-oriented database that is used to store the data for the tasks
- Express: a web framework for building APIs that provide access to the data stored in the database
- React: a frontend library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server

From a server-side perspective, the Task Track app uses the Express web framework to create API endpoints for accessing the data in the MongoDB database. These endpoints are used by the React frontend to retrieve the data and display it to the user. The Node.js runtime is used to run the application on the server and execute the Express and MongoDB code.
